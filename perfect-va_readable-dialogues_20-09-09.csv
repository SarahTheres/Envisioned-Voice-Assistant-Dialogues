user: No, go on
voice_assistant: Bill Morgan’s life has been full of luck – good and bad.  He should have died in June 1998 - and for 14 minutes he did - but somehow doctors managed to revive him after he had a heart attack and spent 15 days in a coma. Mr Morgan, then 37 and living in a caravan park in Melbourne's outer suburbs, was dubbed a 'medical miracle'.  His second lucky break came when he bought an instant scratchcard about a year later and promptly won a brand new Toyota Corolla worth $30,000. The windfall attracted plenty of media attention. And that's when it happened - his claim to viral video fame that's re-emerged some 22 years later and is on everyone's Facebook news feed. The footage captures Mr Morgan buying another scratchcard to re-create the moment for a TV program - only to win the jackpot. 'I just won $250,000 - I'm not joking,' he says in disbelief to the camera. 'I think I'll have another heart attack.'   The extraordinary win and the subsequent call to his fiancee to tell her she could buy a house was shown on Nine's evening news in Melbourne, and then around the world via CNN and the BBC.","user: Kitt, play somFM
